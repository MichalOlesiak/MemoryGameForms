# MemoryGameForms

Hi!

I'm Michael I'm coding for a few month but I'm really interrested in that case since i started. Why I'm coding that is easy question for me, sice I was child I liked solving logical problems and improve some things. I don't like when something doesn't work "because it doesn't work". I'm really keen on learning new things!

I have to say that I made that game just in a few hours because I have had problems with my internet conection, that is why there is not all of functionalities :/.

Hope so You will have a lot of fun playin my memory game! 

Good Luck;
